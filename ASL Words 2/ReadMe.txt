Trasnlera is a English speach to ASL word translator produced by Camden Mercer, Erin Sharpe, Noah Hanrahan, and Jonah hanrahan as part of our Capstone project during our Bachelor's of Computer Engineering. Translera is capable of taking in either spoken English or English text and convert it to either a set of ASL symbols or a letter-by-letter translation to ASL letters.
It is important to note that Translera is not a full replacement for ASL translators, but is better viewed as a proof of concept. Translera also does not produce proper ASL, as it lack the grammatical elements that define ASL as a language, such as locotives and classifier predicates.
This is not the developed version of the Translera application, but rather the final version uploaded to Github. As such, this may not run when downloaded and many of the videos that were part of the original Translera Capstone project are not available (over 900 ASL word videos were cut) due to file size limitations on GitHub.
